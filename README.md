## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I faced problems with loading Emulator so instead of Pixel 3,
I went with Pixel 2, to load my app and then it started working.

I also had trouble implementing the functions at first because
my project was not setup properly. I got it right on my third try.
